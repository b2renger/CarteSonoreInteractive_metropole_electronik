Carte Interactive
===================

This code is for this web-app : http://creation13.metropole-electronik.fr/

it uses webpd and processing-js, to create a web-app where people can re-mix together several soundscapes from chosen places in the university of Rennes 2.

If you run it locally you'll need to authorize your browser to access files from you hard drive.
